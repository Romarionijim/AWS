this allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and on-premises servers withiut having SSH access,
bastion hosts or SSH keys needed.

we have 3 ways accessing the ec2 instances:
1 - open the prot 22 and then use SSH keys
2 - use ec2 instance connect that didnt require SSH
3 - session manager => make sure you have ec2 instance with Amazon linux 2 and make sure the ec2 instance has an IAM role
and this IAM role has allowed access from the ec2 instance to systems manager
