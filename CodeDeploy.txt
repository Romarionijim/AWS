a way to deploy our application automatically
it does not need to use beanstalk or cloudformation
it is completely independant

it works with two things:
it works with EC2 instances
works with on premises servvers

it helps us upgrade the ec2 and on premises versions from v1 to v2 for example

hybrid service => works with any server but you must provision and configure serversd ahead of time with the CodeDeploy agent
CodeDeploy agent assists you to to do all these upgrades

exam => this service allows you to upgrade both EC2 instances, applications and your on premises servers applications automatically
from a single interface
