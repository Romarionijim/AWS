hybrid cloud:
businesses that keep an on-premises infra alongside a cloud infra
there are two ways dealing with it systems
    AWS cloud - console, CLI and AWS API
    one for their on premises infra

AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infra services APIs and tools to build your own applications on premises
just as in the cloud

AWS will setup and manage outposts racks within your on premises infra and you can start leverages AWS services on-premises

you are responsible for the outposts rack physical security

benefits:
low latency access to on-premises systems
local data processing
data residency
easier migration from on premises to the cloud
fully managed service
some services that work on outposts:
ec2 + ebs + s3 + eks + ecs + rds + emr
