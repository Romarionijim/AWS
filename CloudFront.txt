content delivery network (CDN)

exam => anytime you see CDN => think cloudFront
improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
improves user experience
216 point of presence globally (edge locations)
DDoS protection  integration with shield AWS web application firewall

it has several types of origins:

S3 bucket:
    for distributing files and caching them at the edge
    enhanced security with CloudFront origin access control (OAC)
    OAC is replacing origin access identity
    cloudfront can be used as in ingress ( to upload files to s3 )

custom origin (HTTP):
    application load balancer
    ec2 instance
    s3 website
    any http backend

cloudfront vs s3 cross region replication

    cloudfront:
        global edge network
        files are cached for a TTL
        great for static content that must be available everywhere

    s3 cross region replication:
        must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
        files are updated in near real time
        read only
        dynamic content that changes everytime that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

        in summary:
        cloud front is a CDN which is to cache content all around the world
        whereareas S3 cross region replication is to really replicate an entire bucket into another region


S3 transfer acceleration:
as we know s3 bucket is linked to only one region and so sometimes you are looking to transfer files
from all around the world into one specific bucket - and there is a way to speed up the transfer using
s3 transfer acceleration => which will forward the data to the s3 bucket in the target region

how does it work? file in USA => upload it into an edge location that is very close to our user in the USA
and then using the internal network - the edge location will transfer the file into an S3 bucket in another region ( australia )


AWS Global Accelerator
improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement)
2 anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through edge locations
for example user in USA => edge location => public application => edge location => usa

global accelerator vs cloudfront

they both use the AWS global network and it's edge locations around the world
both services integrate with AWS shield for DDos protection
cloud-front - content delivery network
    improves performance for you cacheable content ( such as images and videos )
    content is served at the edge

global accelerator:
    no caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions
    improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
    good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
    good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
