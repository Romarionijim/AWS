Amazon API Gateway

example: building a serverless HTTP API
Lambda doing CRUD with DynamoDB which are both serverless technologies
if I want another client to connect to the lambda function
lambda function is not exposed as an API right away
in this case we need to expose through an API gateway
which is going to provide the client with the rest HTTP API to connect directly to your website
the client will talk to the API gateway via REST API - the API gateway will proxy the requests to your lambda function
which will execute the transformations on your data
it is a fully managed service for to developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs in the cloud
it is serverless and scalable
supports RESTFUL APIs and websockets APIs
supports security, user authentication, api throttling, API keys, monitoring
for the exam => build a serverless API => THINK api GATEWAY AND lAMBDA
