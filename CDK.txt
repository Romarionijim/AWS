AWS cloud development kit CDK

define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language: like Pulumi
    javascript/typescript, python, java, and .net
    when you write the code in your preferred programming language - the code is "compiled" into a cloudformation
    template (JSON,YML)
you can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
    great for Lambda functions
    great for docker containers in ECS / EKS

    programming language => CDK application => cloudformation template => cloudformation
