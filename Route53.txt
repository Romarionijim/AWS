Amazon Route 53
it helps us to deploy a global application.
it is a managed DNS (domain name system)
DNS => it is like a phone book, when you go into a web site and type it's name it searches for that web's ip address
and renders the page based on that IP address, but it returns this DNS name to the client that it is already typed in the URL
so it is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs

most common records in AWS
    www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 === A record (IPV4)
    www.goog.com => 200 1:0db8:85a3:000:000:82a2e:0371:7334 === AAAA IPV4 (quadruple A record)
    search.google.com =? www.google.com -> CNAME: hostname to hostname
    example.com => AWS resource === Alias (example: ELB, Cloudfront, S3, RDS, etc...)

for the exam => Route 53 is a managed DNS

Route 53 routing policies for the exam:

simple routing policy
    no health checks

weighted routing policy:
  allows us to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances
  assign weights for our EC2 instances and then our DNS will make sure that our clients will have
  the percentage (traffic) that was set on each ec2 => it is some kind of load balancing
  we can use health checks
  so in summary the purpose is to distribute traffic between EC2 instances

latency routing policy:
    will look at where the user is located - and if they are located close to US ec2 instance
    then they will be redirected to talk to that server
    and this is based on latency
    in this case route 53 will be used to minimize the latency between the users
    and the servers by making the users connect to the server that is the closest to them
    in summary - it's purpose is to minimize latency

failover routing policy
    disaster recovery - in this case our DNS system will do a health check on the primary EC2 instance
    and in case the priumary instance fails then the route 53 will redirect us to the failover instance to help with
    disaster recovery
    summary - to help with disaster recovery
