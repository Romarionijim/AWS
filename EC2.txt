//EC2

EC2 = elastic compute cloud = infrastructure as a service IaaS on AWS.
consists in the capability of:
1. renting VMs (EC2) => which are called EC2 instances => rent on demand whenever we need.
2. store data on visual drives EBS
3. distributing load across machines
4. scale services using ASG

knowing ec2 is fundamental to understand how the cloud works

EC2 sizing and config options:
* OS for EC2:
linux, windows or macOS
* how much compute power CPU and cores
* how much RAM
* how much storage space (volumes)
    network attachedEBS or EFS
or hardware (EC2 instance store)
network card: speed of the card, public IP address
* firewall rules: security group
* bootstrap script (configure at first launch): ec2 user data

ec2 user data:
it is possible to bootstrap our instances using an ec2 user data script
bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
that script is only run at the instance first start
ec2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
1. installing updates
2. installing software
3. downloading common files from the internet
4. anything you can think of

** the EC2 user data runs with a root user

EC2 instance types - overview
7 different instance types
AWS has the following naming convention:
for example => m5.2xlarge
* m: instance class
* 5: generation of the instance (generation of hardware)
* 2xlarge: the size within the instance class, small, medium, large
the more the size - the more the memory the more the cpu which makes it faster

EC2 types:
* general purposes => great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
* good balance between compute, memory and networking
in the course - we'll be using t2.micro which is a general purpose EC2 instance (free tier)
