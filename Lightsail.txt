Amazon Lightsail

a standalone service
you can get virtual servers, storage, databases and networking
it gives you low and predictable pricing
it is much simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53...
great for people with LITTLE CLOUD EXPERIENCE
can setup notifications and monitoring of your lightsail resources
use cases: deploy a simple web application ( has templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, nodejs .. )
has high availability but no auto scaling, limited AWS integrations

for the exam => someone with no cloud experience and need to get started quickly with low
 and predictable pricing without configuring things much => think lightsail otherwise lightsail will almost
 always be the wrong answer
