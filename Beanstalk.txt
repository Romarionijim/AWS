AWS elastic BeanStalk

Elastic beanstalk
is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
it uses all components => EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, and etc...
but it is all in one view - we still have full control over the configuration
but it is all within BeanStalk
beanstalk => platform as a service PaaS
beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances

it is a managed service
all the EC2 instance / OS configuration is handled by beanstalk
deployment strategy is configurable but performed by elastic beanstalk
capacity provisioning
load balancing and auto-scaling
application health monitoring and responsiveness

my responsibility as a developer:
just the application code

three architicture models:
single instance deployment => good for dev
LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web application
ASG only => for non web apps in production (workers etc...)

beanstalk supports many platforms:
go, java
.net
nodejs
php
ruby
packer
docker
multi docker
preconfigured docker
custom platform

health monitoring => beanstalk has full monitoring suite within the service itself and there is going to be health
agents on each EC2 instance within beanstalk that is going to push metrics to cloudwatch
and within beanstalk you can view these metrics
