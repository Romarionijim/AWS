before pushing the application code to servers, it needs to be stored somewhere
developers usually store code in a repository, using git
aws has a competing product that is codecommit
code commit - AWS service that allows you to store code => source control service that hosts git based repos

the code changes are automatically versioned

benefits:
*Fully managed
*scalable and highly available
*private, secured, integrated with all AWS services
