helps you manage your  ec2 instances and on premises systems at scale
another hybrid AWS service
get operational insights about the stat of your infra
most important features are:
    patching automation for enhances compliance
    run commands across an entire fleet of servers
    store parameter configuration with the SSM parameter store

Works for linux windows macOS and raspberry pi OS

for the exam => anytime you see a way to patch your fleet of EC2 instances or on-premises servers => think of SSM
and if you want to run a command consistently across all your servers

how does it work?
you need first to install the ssm agent onto the systems we control
installed by default on Amazon linux AMI and some ubuntu AMI

if an instance cant be controlled with SSM, it's probably an issue with the SSM agent

thanks to SSM - we can run commands , patch, and configure our servers
