*software packages depend on each other to be built (code dependencies) and new ones are created
*storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management
*traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
so AWS came up with cloudArtifact, that si secure, scalable, and cost effective artifact management for software development
it works with all the common dependency management tools, such as Maven, Gradle, NPM, yarn, twine, pip, nuGet
these can just talk with codeArtifact to store and retrieve these code dependencies

for the exam => codeArtifact is going to be very helpful if your team needs an artifact management system or a place to store
their code dependencies
