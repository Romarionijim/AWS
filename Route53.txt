Amazon Route 53
it helps us to deploy a global application.
it is a managed DNS (domain name system)
DNS => it is like a phone book, when you go into a web site and type it's name it searches for that web's ip address
and renders the page based on that IP address, but it returns this DNS name to the client that it is already typed in the URL
so it is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs

most common records in AWS
    www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 === A record (IPV4)
    www.goog.com => 200 1:0db8:85a3:000:000:82a2e:0371:7334 === AAAA IPV4 (quadruple A record)
    search.google.com =? www.google.com -> CNAME: hostname to hostname
    example.com => AWS resource === Alias (example: ELB, Cloudfront, S3, RDS, etc...)

for the exam => Route 53 is a managed DNS
