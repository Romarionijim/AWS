what is serverless?
is a new paradigm in which the developers dont have to manage servers anymore.
they just deploy the code
or they deploy functions
initially => serverless === FaaS Function as a Service
that means that you just deploy your code and each function will run independently by the lambda service
serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: databases, messaging, storage and etc..
(dosen't include servers managed by the user)
serverless does not mean there are no servers => it means you just dont manage / provision / see them

serverless services that we've been using in this course:
Amazon S3 - use it as a storage layer but we did not manage any servers at all
DynamoDB - we just wen ahead and created a table but we did not provision a server for that table
Fargate - run docker containers => we just send the docker containers and Fargate will automatically
find a way for it to be run
Lambda - the pioneer of serverless services which allows you to run functions in the cloud
