dump db to rds:

create DB tables and declarations in sql file in vscode or in another text editor
copy the db file to the container to a certain dir such as var lib postgres data and name it dump
then connect to the rds endpoint make sure the rds has inbound secuirty group that allows connections and that rds is public with a name and password
spin up a db container such as postgres for example 

you can copy the db file directly into the container 
using docker cp db_dump.sql container-name:/db_dump.sql
connect to rds endpoint and dump the file 

psql -h rds-endpoint -U postgres -d postgres -W -f /data_dump.sql - you will be promt to write the password for the rds password 

that way you dumped the data to the rds 

or you can create docker compose with a volume - get inside the container and create data inside the container 
the data will be in /var/lib/postgresql/data 

you can create a dump file from the data inside the container that is stored in the mentioned path by running the command

pg_dump -h <your_local_host> -U <db-username> -d <database_name> -f /path/to/dump_file.sql -F p (-F p is for plain text) -c is for binary 

after creating a dump file it should be located in the path you defined 

if you wanna dmp t to rds you need to run:

psql -h rds-endpoint -U postgres -d postgres -W -f /var/lib/postgresql/data/data_dump.sql - you will be promt to write the password for the rds password 

that way you dumped the data to the rds 


you can choose both options 

to validate the data exist in the rds 
connect to the rds via the container 


psql -h rds-endpoint -U postgres -d postgres -W 
enter password 

list all tables - if postgres you run \dt 

SELECT *  FROM tablename; 

and you can see your data that is inside the rds
