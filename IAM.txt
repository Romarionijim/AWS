//IAM
managing users
identity and access management => global service.
where you can add groups and users inside groups.
groups contains only users and not other groups.
user can belong to multiple groups.
not best practice to leave users out of a group but still an option.
we create users and groups to let users use our AWS
we manage permissions via IAM.
we need to give users permissions.
users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called IAM policies.
users can be in multiple groups
when ech group has a policy and users have multiple groups they will inherit the policies from each group they're in
do NOT give more permissions than a users actually needs.

IAM Policy structure (JSON)

consists of:
* version, policy language version
* ID, an identifier for the policy (optional)
* statement: one or more individual statements (required)

statement consists of
* Sid: id for the statement - optional
* effect - if the statement allows or denies access to certain API (allow, deny)
* principal: account/user/role to which this policy applies to
* Action: list of actions/APIs this policy allows or denies
* Recourse: list of recourses to which the actions applied to! - s3 bucket, which bucket and etc..
* condition - optional => condition for when this policy is in effect


MFA
multi factor authentication
you want to protect at least your root accounts and IAM users
to secure these accounts we'll: use MFA
MFA = password you know + security device you own
password + MFA generated token => successful login
even if a user has lost his password because it's stolen or hacked - the account will not be compromised since the hacker will
need to get a hold of the physical device such as the user's phone to do a login

1.MFA devices:
* virtual MFA device => google authenticator phone only
* Authy => multi device, support for multiple tokens on a single device
with a virtual MFA device you can have your root account and IAM user and another and another a many users as you want on the  virtual MFA device

there are more such as DUO mobile and etc..

2.UTF security key
* physical device third party such as USB yubikey - supports multiple root and IAM users.

3. hardware key fob

4. AWS govCloud - hardware device

//how can user access AWS?
3 options:
1. AWS management console (protected by password + MFA)
2. AWS CLI (protected by access keys) => access AWS from our terminal => alternative to AWS management console.
3. SDK software development kit for code (protected by access keys)

Access keys are generated through AWS console.
users can manage their own access keys.
access keys are secret - do not share them!
