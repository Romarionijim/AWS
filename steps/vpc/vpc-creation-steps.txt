1. create a vpc
2. create two public subnets in differnt AZ and two private subnets in different AZ
3. choose a CIDR for the VPC for example 10.0.0.0/16
4. choose CIDR range for both public subnets and private subnets - the subnets must be different 
for example - first public subnet 10.0.0.0/24, private subnet 10.0.1.0/24 => second public 10.0.2.0/24 , second private 10.0.3.0/24
5.create internet gateway to connect the vpc to the internet
6.attach the internet gateway to the VPC
7.create a route table in order for the subnets to route to the internet 
    - one public route table -  select the vpc
    - one private route table - select the vpc 
8. go to subnet association and assiosiate the route table with the relevant subnet 
9. go to the public route table and add a route to the internet - add a route from anywehere with CIDR 0.0.0.0/0 and choose inside the internet gateway
that you just created earlier
10. launch an ec2 instance by selecting the vpc and that way the ec2 instance will have access to the internet within that vpc -  enable public ip
11. create a NAT gateway in the public subnet - choose the public subnet to connect the private instance to the internet via the public instnce 
12. add a route to the private route table and choose the NAT gateway 
13. launch ec2 instance for the private subnet without public ip
14. ssh to the private subnet via the public subnet (public ec2 instance) 
    - command => ssh -i keyPaiFilename.pem ec2-user@ipAddressOfThePrivateEc2
