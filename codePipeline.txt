how do we know that codecommit and codebuild are connected?

we can connect them using code pipeline =>
*orchestrate the different step to have the code automatically pushed to production
    code => build => test => provision => deploy
    basis for CI/CD

codepipeline orchestration layer: one way of building a pipeline in AWS
    codeCommit => codeBuild => codeDeploy => elastic beanstalk environment


benefits:
fully managed, compatible with codeCommit => codeBuild => codeDeploy, elastic beanstalk, cloudformation, GitHub, 3rd party services
such as GitHub & custom plugins

it gives you fast delivery and rapid updates
