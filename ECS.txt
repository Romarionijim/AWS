ECS:
Elastic Container Service:
this is used to launch Docker containers on AWS
for ECS => you must maintain and provision the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
so you need to create EC2 instances in advance
AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers
has integrations with the application load balancer
the ec2 instances will be running different containers by the ECS service
the ECS service => anytime is has a new docker container - it will be smart enough to find on which EC2 instance
to place that docker container
for the exam => run docker container on AWS => ECS.

Fargate:
is also used to launch docker containers on AWS but with Fargate we don;t need to provision any infrastructure
(no ec2 instances to manage ) which is simpler.
so we do not need to create any ec2 instances and manage them
it is a serverless offering - don't manage any servers
AWS will just run the containers that we need, based on the CPU/RAM we need for each container.

ECR:
for storing these docker images so that it can be run on AWS - you need to use a container registry =>
Elastic Container Registry
it is a private docker registry on AWS
this is where you store your docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate
