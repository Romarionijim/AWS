multi region => active passive
it means we have two regions => each region has one or multiple AZ and in one region our EC2 instances are going to be active
or our application is going to be active => that means that our users, whenever they are in the world can do reads and writes to
our ec2 instance in the active region
and the other EC2 instance is passive - that means there is data replication between the active region and the passive region
and possibly the users can do reads from the passive region but they cannot do writes to the passive region

so it has global reads latency
but not global write latency since it has to go through the central region
it is increased difficulty since we have multiple regions

and we have active-active
where each EC2 instance is able to take writes and reads and there is replication still happening
