//IAM

managing users
identity and access management => global service.
where you can add groups and users inside groups.
groups contains only users and not other groups.
user can belong to multiple groups.
not best practice to leave users out of a group but still an option.
we create users and groups to let users use our AWS
we manage permissions via IAM.
we need to give users permissions.
users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called IAM policies.
do NOT give more permissions than a users actually needs.
