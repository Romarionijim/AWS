AWS Batch
batch is a fully managed batch processing at ANY SCALE
you can effciently run 100K of thousands of computing batch jobs on AWS easily

batch job => is a job that ahs a start and an end => starts at 1 am and finished at 3 am for example
batch will dynamically launch  EC2 instances or spot instances
AWS batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory
you submit and schedule batch jobs and AWS batch does the rest
how do ou define a batch job?
batch jobs are defined as docker images and run on ECS => anything that can run on ECS can run on batch
helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure

batch vs lambda
lambda:
 has time limit => it's 15min
 limited runtimes => only get access to a few programming languages
 limited temporary disk space
 serverless

Batch:
    me limit - relies on EC2 instances
    any runtime that you want as long it is packaged as a docker image
    for storage you rely on EBS volume / instance store for disk space ( rely on the storage that comes with an EC2 instance )
    it is not serverless - it is a managed service but relies on actual EC2 instances being created
    and these EC2 instances are managed by AWS
