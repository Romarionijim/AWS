a global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
on AWS - this could be regions and or edge locations

decreased latency
    latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
    it takes time for a packer from asia to reach the us
    deploy your application closer to your users to decrease latency - better experience
Disaster recovery
    if an AWS region goes down
    you can fail over to another region
    a DR plan is important

attack protection (cyber) distributed global infra is harder to attack all these locations at once
so your more protected

*global DNS => Route 53 => it is going to help us route the users to the closest deployment with least latency
it is greate for disaster recovery stategies

*global content delivery network (CDN): cloudfront
    replicate part of your application to AWS edge locations - decrease latency
    cache  common requests - improved user experience and decreased latency
