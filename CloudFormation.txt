Deploying and managing infrastructure at scale section

what is cloudformation:
declarative way of outlining your AWS infrastructure, for any resources like terraform
for example with cloudformation template you can say:
    I want a security group
    I want two EC2 instances using this security group
    I want S3 bucket
    I want load balancer for all these
and cloud formation will create these by the the declared order

Benefits:
it is IaaC - no resources are manually create, which is excellent for control
any time you make changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code (CR)

costs:
each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
you can estimate the costs of your resources using the cloudformation template
savings strategy: in X environment you could automate deletion of templates at 5PM and recreated at 8 AM safely

productivity:
ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
automated generation of diagram for our templates
declarative programming ( no need to figure out ordering and orchestration )

dont re invent the wheel
leverage existing templates on the web
leverage documentation

supports almost all AWS resources
if it isnt supported you can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported

for the exam => cloudformation is going to be used when we have IaaC when we need to repeat an architicture
in different environments, different regions or even different AWS accounts
